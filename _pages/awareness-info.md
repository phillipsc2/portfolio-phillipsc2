<h1>DO NOT EVER SUBMIT YOUR INFO TO WEBSITES LIKE THAT!</h1>
<strong>What you just witnessed was a total scam!</strong> To some, that may have been obvious, but scammers utilize scare tactics with great success every day. The previous page is a recreation of real scam websites that use flashing colors, urgent wording/false threats, and loud sounds to create a sense of urgency and panic in users that encounter them, namely their targets are users that don't know much about how computers work. This kind of phishing is not only seen in this website form but most infamously done via phone calls, where a scammer on the other end will claim that their target must hand over information to prevent some kind of disaster.

<h2>Protecting yourself against phishing</h2>
<strong>NEVER SHARE SENSITIVE INFORMATION:</strong> Your financial institution, Microsoft, Amazon, NO REPUTABLE COMPANY will EVER ask you to withdraw cash, provide passwords, or ANY sensitive information. Anyone telling you to do this has an ulterior motive.

<strong>BE SKEPTICAL OF URGENCY:</strong> Scams will typically try to convince you that there is an imminent deadline of some kind, like on the previous page.

<strong>PLEASE USE COMMON SENSE</strong>: Ask yourself, does it sound too good to be true?
