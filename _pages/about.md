About Me
======
Hi, I'm Cameron. I am a first-year student at Hocking College, majoring in Cybersecurity & Networking. I've always been very interested in networking and computers since I was young and I'm eager to expand my knowledge and career skills. In my spare time I tinker with all sorts of tech, but I'm especially fond of old computers. I also self-host video game servers every now and again.
