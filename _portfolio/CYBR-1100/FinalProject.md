We were prompted to create a cybersecurity awareness campaign as our final project for this class. Initially we were given the options of a slideshow or poster however I opted to create a webpage for phishing awareness. This way it is located right on my website. The page itself resembles infamous online scams, with flashing lights and loud alarms going off, and big bold red text saying that you're in danger and you need to submit information immediately. When users hit "submit", they are transported to a page that provides extensive information on phishing, what it is and how to spot and avoid it. Users are provided a photosensitivity warning before proceeding. Regarding the target audience, ideally those who would click submit on a webpage like that would receive the information they need, meanwhile those who know better and therefore don't need the info will just close the tab.
