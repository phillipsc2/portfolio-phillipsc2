Star Toplogy
--
Star Topology is a network design where every end device (computers) is connected to a central hub (a switch, or router). The connections form a 'star' shape. This setup is common due to its simplicity and easier troubleshooting, though failure of the central hub would result in the entire networking going down. 
You need end-user devices, a central connecting device, and the necessary cabling (mostly twisted-pair Ethernet cables) to connect everything together in star topology. In order to configure this type of network in the Day 1 lab I had to use straight-through Ethernet cables to connect the computers to the central switch. Other than that, this type of network is very simple so not much detailed configuration is needed.
