# Week 1 – Introduction to Security Awareness
 
**Description:**  
The textbooks and Netacad covered subjects such as what exactly cybersecurity is, online identities and the importance of anonymity, how personal data is used, what exactly bad actors and hackers want, white/black/gray hats and their intentions, and other basics. 
 
**Artifacts:**
**Case Project 1-1: Personal Attack Experiences**
In middle school a friend of mine had no knowledge of Internet safety and would constantly download free games from less than reputable websites. In 2018 they downloaded some random game on their low-end HP laptop running Windows 10. For some reason they had disabled Windows Defender. If I recall, it was because it kept “making annoying alerts”, which they were confident were false positives. Really, just a perfect storm of bad decisions. There were probably countless malware programs running on their computer at all times, but one stood out to us in particular, because it didn’t appear to do anything except creep out the user. It would copy weird creepy pictures onto the user’s desktop randomly. This freaked my friend out enough to completely reset his Windows installation and start anew, this time he would keep Windows Defender on. He probably could have prevented this by using common sense online. The attack was successful because it hid among a seemingly normal program.
 
**Reflection:**  
I learned about the speed and severity of cyberattacks, how quickly they come and go, and how commonplace they are in the modern day. I learned about the fundamental basics behind cybersecurity and cybersecurity concepts.
